# Improving-Deep-neural-network
For this course, I will be able to learn regularization, hyperparameter tuning, optimization functions, ...
- The regularization files will be used for regularize a model with non-regularization method, L2-regularization, and Dropout method.
- Gradient Checking files will use numerical gradient approximation method to test if the gradient obtained from backprop is correct
- Optimization functions and decays research about Gradient Descient with/without momentum and Adam algorithm, also. I looked on learning rate decays with/without time interval to analyze the accuracy of the methods.
- Create a simple dnn model using tensorflow without directly implementing keras.layers.Dense
